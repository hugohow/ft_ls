[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hugohow/ft_ls.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hugohow/ft_ls)

`ft_ls -RulrSlg ~/` works perfectly and has exactly the same beahaviour than ls.

Implementation of balanced binary tree (avl tree) to get good performance on recursive call.

## TO DO

Add `make test` for linux
